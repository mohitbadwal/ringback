"""ringback-voice MCP — exposes a live phone call as speak/listen tools.

The calling Claude session IS the conversational brain: it calls call_start to
ring the user, then alternates listen()/speak() each turn, and call_end() when
done. No LLM API key — the model already running this tool does the thinking.

Requires pjsua2 (built from source) + whisper.cpp + Piper/say (TTS) + ffmpeg.
Launched via run_voice_mcp.sh (macOS) or run_voice_mcp.py (cross-platform), which set
PYTHONPATH + the OS dynamic-linker path so `import voice_agent` (pjsua2) resolves.
